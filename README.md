# PapaParser + FileSaver-CSV-to-JSON-Downloader


Welcome to this Papa Parse + FileSaverr Tutorial. I made this project as an experiment as i am trying to learn and work on bigger Javascript related applications. While working i needed to convert easily available CSV file sheets into JSON data, and stumbled onto the Paper Parser and FileSaver JS library.

PapaParser - is a great and powerful CSV Parser for JavaScript.
